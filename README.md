# What statistics determines if a player wins MVP?
By taking a look at the most important features needed to predict whether or not a player is MVP, it is clear that advanced stats (VORP, PER, WS48) that measure more than just PPG are big indicators of determining an MVP.
However, within the top 5 most important features we can see that Win% plays a very imporatant part in the prediction. This tells us that simply having good stats is not enough to win the MVP vote.
MVP winners are heavily determined by how succesful their team is in the regular season. In cases where a player had better stats but wasn't on a winning team (i.e. Jokic VS Shai) it is up for debate whether or not MVP winners should rely so much on Win%.

# Applications of Model
Model will be tested in the 2026 MVP vote to determine performance. If accurate, the model has the possibility of winning majority of bets due to relying purely on statistics and without human emotion.
